# Card_games
Its a stochastic multi-agent game

Please create the following game in any Programming language. There are 16 cards in the game - 8 different pairs of cards (they pair cards are identical). They are all faced down at the start of the game. On each turn it is allowed to open 2 cards (one at a time ). If the cards match, the pair disappears, if not- they close back. The game continues until all pairs disappear. At the end of the game it should show how many steps have been completed. Opening 2 cards at the same time counts as one step.
